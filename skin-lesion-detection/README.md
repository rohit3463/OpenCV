Automate skin lesion(Melanoma) diagnosis using opencv

Melanoma is a skin cancer disease. According to stats the number of cases of melanoma is increasing rapidly. This melanoma is highly curable if it is detected early. So our idea is to automate skin lesion segmentation and diagnosis system using ABCDE parameters. 
A - Asymmetry
B - Border
C - Color
D - Diameter
E - Evolution
Our application will decide whether the skin lesion is cancerous or not checking through pre-determined ABCDE parameters. The ABCDE parameters will be detected using opencv and will be evaluated over time for a patient.
